My partner and I are currently living in Leeds, having moved back home from Glasgow. 

The vast majority of my time is spent on the publishing co-operative I started: Peregrine Coast Press. I'm designing, publishing, and selling independently created tabletop RPGs and books from folks all over the world with the help of 3 incredibly talented friends. We're taking on creative work, too!

Currently working towards making PCP sustainable as a part-time venture and getting a job as a designer to keep the lights on in the meantime.
